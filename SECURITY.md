## Security Principles

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- Only authorized users should access the application.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to ensure users can only perform actions relevant to their role (e.g., admin, supervisor, intern).
- Login credentials are securely stored using hashing algorithms.

### 2. **Data Protection**
- All sensitive data (e.g., intern records, evaluations) is encrypted at rest using AES encryption.
- Data in transit between modules or databases is protected using TLS or equivalent.

### 3. **Secure Coding Practices**
- Input validation and output encoding are strictly enforced to prevent injection attacks.
- Exception handling is implemented to avoid exposing system internals.
- Use of secure APIs and libraries only.

### 4. **Session Management**
- Sessions are time-bound and expire after periods of inactivity.
- User sessions are protected against hijacking using unique session tokens.

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**
- All login attempts, task updates, and data changes are logged securely.
- Audit trails are reviewed regularly to detect and prevent unauthorized activities.

### 6. **Dependency Management**
- External libraries and frameworks are regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Only trusted and verified third-party packages are used.

### 7. **Backup and Recovery**
- Regular backups are scheduled to prevent data loss.
- Recovery procedures are tested periodically to ensure system resilience.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with enterprise-level Identity Providers (e.g., LDAP, SSO)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- End-to-end encryption for communication between desktop clients and remote servers
