# Stagiary-Management
 I created a desktop application named "Stagiary Management" using Java. 
 This application efficiently manages and tracks the progress of interns within an organization, allowing for seamless onboarding, task assignment, and performance evaluation. 
 With its intuitive user interface and robust functionality, Stagiary Management simplifies the process of managing and monitoring interns, enhancing overall productivity and coordination.
